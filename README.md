# LSB-steganography-using-AES-Algorithm
Steganography is a technique of hiding text within an image, video or audio. This project gives a new way of hiding plaintext within an image by splitting the odd and even characters using LSB steganography and encrypt it using PBKDF2 and ARGON2 password hashing technique to make it more secure
